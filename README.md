## Tessellation Shader in OpenGL 4 and procedural Terrain ##
*A little OpenGL application which renders a procedural terrain with the use of a Tessellation Shader*

**depandancies needed:**
* GLFW 
* Assimp
* OpenGL 4
* *An OpenGL 4 ready graphics card!*

Compile them and put in *Libraries/* directory (I'll upload the compiled libraries soon). *Include/* directory is been already uploaded.
