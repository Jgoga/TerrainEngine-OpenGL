A special thanks to [Prof. Stefano Berretti](https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/stefano-berretti/),  [Joey DeVries](https://learnopengl.com/), [Etay Meiri](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial30/tutorial30.html) and [ThinMatrix' YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HusvGeEDU_U&list=PLRIWtICgwaX23jiqVByUs0bqhnalNTNZh) for their awesome OpenGL tutorials!

It was initially made in collaboration with @rickie95 as a course project, but even after the delivery I decided to keep working on it implementing the volumetric clouds rendering, with the hope that I'll have the time (and the will!) to add other features!
